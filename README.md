## Single Select

Design Pattern: [Listbox](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#Listbox)

> A listbox widget presents a list of options and allows a user to select one or more of them. A listbox that allows a single option to be chosen is a single-select listbox; one that allows multiple options to be selected is a multi-select listbox.
