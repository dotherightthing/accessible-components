## Single Select

Design Pattern: [Listbox](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#Listbox)

> A listbox widget presents a list of options and allows a user to select one or more of them. A listbox that allows a single option to be chosen is a single-select listbox; one that allows multiple options to be selected is a multi-select listbox.

### ARIA: listbox role

<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/listbox_role>

> The listbox role is used to identify an element that creates a list from which a user may select one or more static items, similar to the HTML `<select>` element. Unlike `<select>`, a listbox can contain images. Each child of a listbox should have a role of option.
